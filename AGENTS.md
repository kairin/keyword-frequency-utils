# AGENTS.md - Email ETL and 5-Layer Archival System

This document provides AI agents with project-specific instructions for developing and maintaining the **Email ETL and 5-Layer Archival System**. This serves as the **definitive specification source** following the [agents.md standard](https://agents.md/).

## Project Overview

This repository implements a **Complete Email Archival Solution** for organizations that can only access email through browser-based interfaces (Outlook PWA). The system creates **5 redundant archive layers** to ensure data preservation, accessibility, and workflow integration.

## üéØ Context-Aware Command Reference
## Keyword Extraction Utility

This repository includes a utility script for **keyword extraction and frequency analysis** from text-based datasets. The script (`run.py`) scans all `.txt` files in a directory, extracts comma-separated keywords, counts their frequencies, and outputs both a CSV summary and a bar chart visualization of the top keywords.

**Purpose:** Supports rapid dataset analysis, metadata tagging, and downstream workflow automation by providing a clear overview of keyword distributions in training or archival data.

**Key Features:**
- Automated keyword extraction from all `.txt` files
- Frequency counting and CSV export
- Top keyword visualization (bar chart)
- No external configuration required; runs as a standalone analysis tool

To run this utility inside the project's UV-managed environment (recommended):

```bash
# Install UV (one-time)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install dependencies declared in pyproject.toml
uv sync --dev

# Run the utility
uv run python run.py --input-dir . --output-csv keyword_frequency.csv --top 20
```

**CRITICAL FOR AI AGENTS**: This project maintains strict separation between production and development tooling to ensure proper context usage.

### üè≠ Production Commands (End Users - Email Processing)
**Context**: Deployed system, actual email processing, production runs
```bash

## Core Principles

### Your Role and Objective

- **Role**: You are an expert software engineering assistant specializing in email processing, browser automation, and multi-format archival systems.
- **Primary Function**: Develop and maintain a comprehensive email ETL pipeline that downloads emails from Outlook PWA, processes them into multiple archival formats, and generates downstream workflow documents.
- **Objective**: Help the user safely and efficiently manage organizational emails through a 5-layer redundant archival system with task extraction and workflow automation.

### Project Mission

This repository implements a **Complete Email Archival Solution** for organizations that can only access email through browser-based interfaces (Outlook PWA). The system creates **5 redundant archive layers** to ensure data preservation, accessibility, and workflow integration.

### Core Principles

1.  **Multi-Layer Redundancy**: Always create multiple archival formats to prevent data loss and ensure accessibility across different systems.
2.  **Browser-First Approach**: All email access is through browser automation (Playwright) as this is the only available method.
3.  **Convention is Law**: Adhere to existing project conventions and the established 5-layer archival pattern.
4.  **Verify, Don't Assume**: Never assume dependencies are available. Always check `requirements.txt` and existing code.
5.  **Task-Oriented Processing**: Every email should be analyzed for actionable tasks and workflow integration opportunities.
6.  **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Support both local Linux environment and Windows office PC integration.

## 2. Repository Setup & Organization

### MANDATORY Repository Structure

**CRITICAL**: This repository MUST maintain the following exact structure. Any deviation from this organization is strictly prohibited:

```

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/                        # ALL LOG FILES GO HERE
```

### Repository Organization Rules

**CRITICAL ROOT FOLDER CLEANLINESS**: The root directory MUST contain ONLY these files:
- `AGENTS.md` (this file)
- `CLAUDE.md` (Claude-specific instructions)  
- `GEMINI.md` (Gemini-specific instructions)
- `README.md` (project overview)
- `run` (ONE interactive bash script with all functionality)

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS**:
1. **NO ADDITIONAL SCRIPTS IN ROOT**: No `install_*.sh`, `test_*.py`, `scan_*.py`, or any other scripts
2. **NO SOURCE CODE IN ROOT**: All Python modules MUST be in `src/` with proper subfolders
3. **NO DOCUMENTATION IN ROOT**: All docs MUST be in `docs/` folder
4. **NO CONFIGURATION IN ROOT**: All config files MUST be in `config/` folder
5. **NO UTILITY SCRIPTS IN ROOT**: All utility scripts MUST be in `scripts/` folder

**MANDATORY ORGANIZATION**:
- **PROPER MODULE STRUCTURE**: All `src/` subfolders MUST have `__init__.py` files
- **RELATIVE IMPORTS**: Use proper relative imports between modules
- **PATH HANDLING**: All file paths MUST be relative to project root with proper `../../` navigation
- **SINGLE ENTRY POINT**: Only `run` should exist in root as the interactive script
- **ANTI-SCRIPT PROLIFERATION**: Never create multiple scripts to solve issues - consolidate functionality within existing modules

**TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS**:
- **MANDATORY MCP SERVER USAGE**: When in doubt about implementation or problem resolution, ALWAYS use available MCP servers for verification:
  - **context7 MCP Server**: REQUIRED for checking latest documentation and best practices with "use context7" in queries
  - **Playwright MCP Server**: REQUIRED for browser automation instead of creating duplicate functionality
  - **Verification Over Assumption**: It is better to use MCP servers to verify and be certain rather than not verifying
- **NO FUNCTION DUPLICATION**: Reuse existing functions rather than creating new scripts
- **DOCUMENTATION VERIFICATION**: Always verify implementation approaches against latest documentation via context7 before proceeding

**COMMIT AND VERSION CONTROL REQUIREMENTS**:
- **COMMIT NAMING SCHEMA**: All commits MUST follow the format: `YYYYMMDD-HHMM-short-descriptor`
  - Date and time first (local timezone)
  - Short descriptor (2-4 words) describing the main implementation
  - Example: `20250822-1435-docker-style-progress`
- **BRANCH NAMING**: Feature branches should follow: `feature/YYYYMMDD-short-descriptor`
- **COMMIT MESSAGES**: Must elaborate on user-liked implementations and highlight outstanding issues
- **DOCUMENTATION UPDATES**: Always update relevant .md files when committing new specifications

### Development Environment Setup

**Modern UV-First Workflow** (replaces traditional pip/venv):

1.  **Install UV Package Manager**: One-time system setup.
    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
    ```
2.  **Initialize UV Project**: Automatically creates .venv and manages dependencies.
    ```bash
    uv sync                    # Creates .venv, installs dependencies from pyproject.toml
    ```
3.  **Install Playwright Browsers**: Required for browser automation.
    ```bash
    uv run playwright install chromium
    ```
4.  **Verify Directory Structure**: Ensure all required folders exist.
    ```bash
    mkdir -p data/{downloads,processed,archive,discovery} logs
    ```

**UV Benefits Over Traditional pip/venv:**
- **10-100x faster** dependency resolution and installation
- **Automatic virtual environment management** (no manual .venv activation needed)
- **Universal lockfile support** for reproducible builds
- **Built-in Python version management**
- **Single tool** replacing pip, venv, pip-tools, and virtualenv

### File Organization Enforcement

- **NEVER** place Python scripts in the root directory
- **ALWAYS** use the `src/` folder structure for code organization
- **ALWAYS** place documentation in `docs/` folder
- **ALWAYS** use proper relative imports and path handling
- **ALWAYS** maintain the established folder hierarchy

### CRITICAL Security Requirements

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: NEVER commit or upload any of the following:

- **Passwords or Credentials**: No email passwords, API keys, or authentication tokens
- **Personal Email Content**: No actual email data, attachments, or message content
- **Authentication Sessions**: No browser session data or cookies
- **Configuration with Secrets**: No files containing personal email addresses or sensitive settings
- **Database Files**: No DuckDB files containing actual email data

**SECURITY ENFORCEMENT**:
- All authentication is browser-based with manual login completion
- No credentials are stored in code or configuration files
- All sensitive data stays in `data/` folder which should be gitignored
- Email addresses in examples should be generic placeholders only
- Regular security audits of repository content before commits
- **COMMIT SECURITY**: Never commit sensitive data, always review changes before pushing
- **BRANCH PROTECTION**: Use feature branches for development, merge to main after review

## 3. System Architecture & Authentication

### 5-Layer Archival Architecture

This system implements a comprehensive 5-layer redundant archival approach:

1. **Layer 1: Organized Folder Structure** - Emails categorized by business function (Kyocera, Staff, Financial, Equipment, BCM, General)
2. **Layer 2: Evolution Email Client Integration** - EML files converted to mbox format for local Evolution client
3. **Layer 3: Thunderbird Email Client Integration** - MSG files converted for Thunderbird Local Folders
4. **Layer 4: PST Export for Office PC** - Windows-compatible PST files for office computer synchronization
5. **Layer 5: Multi-Format Archives** - JSON, HTML, Markdown, Parquet, CSV formats for various use cases

### Authentication Requirements

This project requires authenticating with a Microsoft 365 account through Outlook PWA with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) support. Authentication is handled through browser automation rather than API tokens.

**Key Authentication Facts:**
- **Method**: Browser-based login through Playwright automation
- **MFA Support**: Manual completion required during browser session
- **Session Management**: Maintained during processing session only
- **Security**: No credentials stored, relies on browser session cookies

A detailed guide on authentication handling is available in the `AUTHENTICATION.md` file. All agents must review this document before modifying authentication-related code.

**[Read the Authentication Guide](./AUTHENTICATION.md)**

## 4. Development Workflow (Standard Operating Procedure)

Follow this structured workflow for all development tasks (e.g., bug fixes, new features).

1.  **Understand the Context**:
    - Use `list_directory` and `glob` to explore the file structure.
    - Use `read_file` and `search_file_content` to analyze existing code and identify relevant files and logic.

2.  **Formulate and Communicate a Plan**:
    - Create a clear, step-by-step plan for the required changes.
    - Briefly communicate this plan to the user before you begin implementation. Example: "Okay, I will add a function to `utils.py` and then add a unit test for it in `tests/test_utils.py`. Should I proceed?"

3.  **Write or Update Tests (Test-Driven Development)**:
    - For new functionality, write tests *before* writing the implementation code.
    - For bug fixes, first write a failing test that reproduces the bug.
    - Identify the project's testing framework and conventions by examining existing test files.

4.  **Implement Code Changes**:
    - Use the most appropriate tool for the job (`write_file` for new files, `replace` for targeted modifications).
    - Ensure all new code aligns with the project's style and conventions.

5.  **Verify Your Work**:
    - Run the entire test suite to ensure your changes haven't introduced regressions.
    - Run any available linters or static analysis tools (e.g., `ruff`, `pylint`, `prettier`). Find the correct commands in the project's configuration files or `README`.

## 4. Tool-Specific Guidelines

-   **`read_file`**: Always use this to examine a file's content *before* attempting to modify it.
-   **`write_file`**: Ideal for creating new files or for significant rewrites of existing files. Be cautious when overwriting a file; ensure you have its latest content.
-   **`replace`**: Prefer this for small, targeted changes. To avoid errors, provide at least 3 lines of context before and after the `old_string` argument.
-   **`run_shell_command`**:
    - **Safety First**: You *must* explain any command that modifies the filesystem or system state before executing it.
    - **Non-Interactive**: Whenever possible, use non-interactive flags (e.g., `pip install -y`, `npm init -y`). Avoid commands that require interactive user input.

## 5. Code Style and Conventions

-   **The Golden Rule**: The existing code is the ultimate style guide.
-   **Comments**: Add comments to explain the *why*, not the *what*, especially for complex or non-obvious logic. Do not add comments that talk to the user.
-   **Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes that are consistent with the existing codebase.
-   **Typing**: If the project uses type hints, apply them to all new code.

## 6. Project-Specific Architecture: Complete Email Archival Pipeline

This repository implements a comprehensive email ETL and archival pipeline designed for organizations with browser-only email access. The system processes emails through multiple stages and creates redundant archives for maximum data preservation and accessibility.

### Complete Workflow Overview - 6 Phases

Implementation Strategy Based on Outlook PWA Research (docs/Outlook-PWA-Email-Extraction.md):

#### Phase 1: Enhanced Authentication (PRIORITY: CRITICAL)
- **Framework Migration**: Replace Selenium with Microsoft Playwright
- **TOTP Integration**: Implement PyOTP library for MFA automation
- **Session Management**: Use `context.storage_state(path="auth.json")` for persistent sessions
- **Certificate-based Auth**: Leverage Playwright 1.46+ native CBA support

#### Phase 2: Robust DOM Extraction (PRIORITY: HIGH)
- **Fallback Selectors**: Implement role-based attributes (`[role="row"]`, `[role="document"]`)
- **JavaScript Injection**: Direct email data access without DOM traversals
- **Element Stability**: Use data-testid attributes and ARIA labels over CSS classes
- **Multi-Selector Strategy**: 3+ fallback selectors for each element type

#### Phase 3: Infrastructure Hardening (PRIORITY: MEDIUM)
- **Containerization**: Docker deployment for 65% reduction in environment failures
- **Headless Automation**: Xvfb configuration with `--server-args='-screen 0 1920x1080x24'`
- **Rate Limiting**: 2-5 second delays with human-like interaction patterns
- **Error Recovery**: Exponential backoff with jitter for retry mechanisms

#### Phase 4: Database Architecture - DuckDB (PRIORITY: MEDIUM)
- **Storage Migration**: DuckDB implementation for 75-95% compression rates
- **Schema Design**: Normalized tables for emails, recipients, headers, attachments
- **Full-Text Search**: Built-in FTS with BM25 scoring for sub-second searches
- **UPSERT Operations**: Incremental updates with duplicate detection

#### Phase 5: Multi-Client Integration (PRIORITY: LOW)
- **Evolution Integration**: EML files converted to mbox format
- **Thunderbird Support**: MSG files for Local Folders
- **PST Export**: Windows-compatible PST files for office PC
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Linux development with Windows compatibility

#### Phase 6: Task Extraction & Workflow (PRIORITY: LOW)
- **Pattern-Based Detection**: Business-specific regex patterns
- **Document Generation**: Actionable workflow documents
- **Relationship Mapping**: Connect related emails and tasks
- **Priority Assignment**: Urgent task identification from content

### Key System Components

- **`complete_email_pipeline.py`**: Main orchestrator for the entire pipeline
- **`outlook_email_downloader.py`**: Playwright-based browser automation for email downloads
- **`email_processor.py`**: Processes EML/MSG files and extracts content/metadata
- **`email_archival_manager.py`**: Creates 5-layer archival system with email client integration
- **`document_generator.py`**: Generates business workflow documents from extracted tasks

### DuckDB Schema

The core database includes these key tables:

- **`email_downloads`**: Tracks downloaded email files (EML/MSG paths, processing status)
- **`processed_emails`**: Stores extracted email content, metadata, and attachments
- **`email_tasks`**: Manages identified tasks with business categorization and relationships
- **Task-specific views**: For querying pending tasks, overdue items, and related task groups

### Business-Specific Task Categories

The system automatically categorizes and extracts tasks for:

- **Kyocera Equipment**: TASKalfa printer monitoring, counter readings, maintenance alerts
- **Staff Management**: New hires, transfers, resignations, equipment assignments
- **Financial Processing**: Invoice processing, purchase orders, vendor management
- **Equipment Tracking**: Asset assignments, returns, maintenance requests
- **BCM (Business Continuity)**: Disaster recovery, compliance, security incidents

When modifying the database schema or task extraction patterns, ensure you update corresponding processing scripts and provide migration paths.

## 7. Email Archival System Best Practices

### Development Guidelines for Email Processing

| Do ‚úÖ                                                              | Don't ‚ùå                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Always create multiple archival formats for redundancy             | Rely on a single archive format that could become inaccessible       |
| Test browser automation with both headless and GUI modes          | Assume Playwright scripts work without testing actual email downloads |
| Preserve original EML and MSG files before any processing         | Modify original email files without backup                           |
| Categorize emails into business-specific folders                  | Put all emails in a single large archive                            |
| Extract tasks and generate workflow documents                     | Process emails without identifying actionable items                  |
| Support both Evolution and Thunderbird email client integration   | Focus on only one email client or format                            |
| Create PST exports for Windows office PC compatibility            | Ignore cross-platform requirements                                  |
| Use DuckDB for efficient querying and task relationship mapping   | Store all data in flat files without database benefits              |
| Handle authentication through browser sessions (no stored creds)  | Attempt to store or hardcode any authentication credentials         |
| Generate comprehensive logs for debugging browser automation       | Run automation without proper error logging and retry mechanisms    |

### Task Extraction Guidelines

- **Pattern-Based Detection**: Use regex patterns specific to your organization's email patterns
- **Business Context**: Understand Kyocera equipment IDs, staff movement processes, financial workflows
- **Relationship Mapping**: Connect related emails (e.g., staff movement ‚Üí equipment assignment)
- **Priority Assignment**: Identify urgent tasks from email content and context
- **Document Generation**: Create actionable documents for downstream business processes

### Integration Requirements

- **Multi-Platform Support**: Ensure compatibility with Linux (Evolution), cross-platform (Thunderbird), and Windows (PST)
- **Incremental Processing**: Support partial runs and incremental email downloads
- **Error Recovery**: Handle network issues, authentication timeouts, and file corruption gracefully
- **Data Validation**: Verify email content extraction and attachment preservation

## 8. User Interface Specifications

### Docker-Style Progress Display Specification

**Implementation Date**: 2025-08-22 14:30
**User Feedback**: "visually, i like how steps that are within a major step is being displayed with the relevant tree structure. i think this implementation is good."

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS**:
1. **Tree Structure Visualization**: All command execution within steps MUST use tree characters:
   - `‚îú‚îÄ` for intermediate items
   - `‚îî‚îÄ` for final items
   - `‚îÇ` for continuation lines
   - Proper indentation for nested output

2. **Step Progress Tracking**:
   - `‚è≥ STEP X: Description` (in progress)
   - `‚úÖ STEP X COMPLETE: Description (Xs)` (success)
   - `‚ùå STEP X FAILED: Description (Xs)` (failure)
   - Duration tracking in seconds

3. **Collapsible Section Management**:
   - Full execution details during step
   - `‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê COMPLETED STEPS SUMMARY ‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê` between major steps
   - Collapsed summary when transitioning to next step
   - Final summary with statistics at completion

4. **Real Command Transparency**:
   - Show actual commands being executed
   - Display real-time output with proper formatting
   - Exit code verification and display
   - No hardcoded status messages

5. **Outstanding Implementation Issues** (RESOLVED 2025-08-22 15:15):
   - **Status Progression**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED - Progress indicators with spinners for long operations
   - **Major Step Collapsing**: Completed major steps should collapse to single-line summaries at end  
   - **Interactive Feedback**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED - Progress bars and spinners for long-running operations

6. **Progress Indicator Requirements** (NEW 2025-08-22 15:15):
   - **Long Operation Detection**: Operations >3 seconds MUST show progress indicators
   - **Spinner Animation**: Use rotating spinner (‚†ã‚†ô‚†π‚†∏‚†º‚†¥‚†¶‚†ß‚†á‚†è) during package installations
   - **Progress Messages**: Show "Working..." messages with dots animation for user feedback
   - **No Hanging Appearance**: Never leave users wondering if script is frozen

**COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENT**: All future script development MUST implement this Docker-style progress display pattern for user transparency and visual appeal.

## Code Style Guidelines

### Modern Python Standards with Ruff
- **Type Hints**: Required for all new functions and classes
- **Docstrings**: Google-style docstrings for all public methods
- **Ruff Integration**: Single tool replacing Black, isort, Flake8, pyupgrade
- **Line Length**: Maximum 88 characters (Black/Ruff formatter standard)
- **Naming Conventions**: snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes
- **Import Organization**: Automatic with Ruff (replaces isort)
- **Code Upgrading**: Automatic syntax modernization with Ruff (replaces pyupgrade)

### Project-Specific Patterns
- **Path Handling**: Always use `Path` objects from `pathlib`
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch with specific exception types
- **Logging**: Use structured logging with context information
- **Configuration**: Environment variables via `python-dotenv` for sensitive data
- **Database**: DuckDB connections must use proper context managers

### Browser Automation Standards
- **Playwright Over Selenium**: Mandatory migration to Playwright framework
- **Session State**: Always save authentication state for reuse
- **Element Selection**: Multiple fallback strategies for DOM elements
- **Human-like Patterns**: Random delays and interaction patterns
- **Error Recovery**: Robust retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

## Testing Requirements

### Test Structure
- **Unit Tests**: All core functions in `src/` modules
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end pipeline testing
- **Browser Tests**: Playwright automation with test authentication
- **Performance Tests**: Email processing speed and memory usage

### Test Execution
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/unit/ -v              # Unit tests only
pytest tests/integration/ -v       # Integration tests only
pytest tests/browser/ -v           # Browser automation tests
```

### Coverage Requirements
- **Minimum Coverage**: 80% for all core modules
- **Critical Functions**: 95% coverage for email processing and authentication
- **Browser Tests**: Mock authentication, real DOM interaction patterns

## Security Considerations

### Authentication Security
- **No Stored Credentials**: Browser-based authentication only
- **Session Isolation**: Separate contexts for different authentication flows
- **MFA Compliance**: Support for TOTP, certificates, and conditional access
- **Token Management**: Secure handling of temporary access passes

### Data Protection
- **Email Content**: Never commit actual email data to repository
- **Attachment Handling**: Secure temporary storage with cleanup
- **Database Security**: DuckDB files excluded from version control
- **Logging Security**: No sensitive data in log files

### Infrastructure Security
- **Container Security**: Minimal Docker images with security scanning
- **Network Security**: HTTPS-only communications, certificate validation
- **File Permissions**: Proper permission settings for email archives
- **Backup Security**: Encrypted backups for production data

## Implementation Phases - Execution Plan

### Phase 1 (Week 1): Authentication & Framework - CRITICAL
**Status: PENDING**
**Prerequisites: UV and Ruff setup complete**

```bash
# Verify modern tooling is ready
uv --version && uv run ruff --version

# Development workflow
uv run ruff check --fix src/     # Auto-fix linting issues
uv run ruff format src/          # Format code
uv run pytest tests/             # Run tests
```

**Tasks:**
- Migrate from Selenium to Playwright using `uv add playwright>=1.46.0`
- Implement TOTP authentication with PyOTP: `uv add pyotp>=2.8.0`
- Configure persistent session management with UV-managed dependencies

## Quality Assurance Standards

### Modern Code Quality Tools (UV + Ruff First)
- **Ruff Linting**: `uv run ruff check src/` - 800+ built-in rules, 10-100x faster than Flake8
- **Ruff Formatting**: `uv run ruff format src/` - Drop-in Black replacement
- **Type Checking**: `uv run mypy src/` - Strict mode type validation
- **Security Scanning**: `uv run bandit -r src/` - Security vulnerability detection
- **Dependency Management**: `uv lock` and `uv sync` - Fast, reliable dependency resolution

### UV + Ruff Integration Benefits
- **Performance**: 10-100x faster than traditional tools (pip, Black, Flake8)
- **Consolidation**: Ruff replaces Black, isort, Flake8, pyupgrade in single tool
- **Reliability**: UV provides deterministic dependency resolution with lockfiles
- **Simplicity**: Single `uv run` command for all development tasks

### Verification Workflow
1. **Pre-Implementation**: Always query context7 for latest documentation with "use context7"
2. **UV Dependency Check**: `uv sync` to ensure dependencies are current
3. **Ruff Quality Gates**: `uv run ruff check --fix src/` and `uv run ruff format src/`
4. **Type and Security**: `uv run mypy src/` and `uv run bandit -r src/`
5. **Testing**: `uv run pytest tests/` with comprehensive coverage
6. **Documentation**: Update relevant .md files with changes

### Performance Standards
- **Email Processing**: <1 second per email for metadata extraction
- **Browser Automation**: <30 seconds per email download
- **Database Operations**: <100ms for typical queries
- **Memory Usage**: <500MB for processing 1000 emails
- **Storage Efficiency**: >75% compression with DuckDB
